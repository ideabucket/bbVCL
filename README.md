# BBEdit Language Module for Varnish Configuration Language (VCL)

A [codeless language module][clm] for [BBEdit][bbedit] to support syntax highlighting and code folding for [Varnish Configuration Language][vcl].

[bbedit]: http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/
[vcl]: https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/VCL

At the moment this is based on the syntax for the 2.x branch of Varnish (because that's I work with on a day to day basis). Updates for the 3.x and 4.x branches should follow shortly.
